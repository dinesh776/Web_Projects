# Indian Flag Project

This project showcases the Indian flag using only HTML and CSS. It is a simple representation of the flag, including the three horizontal stripes (saffron, white, and green) and the Ashoka Chakra in the center.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the Indian flag.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the flag and its elements.

## How It Works

1. The flag consists of three horizontal divisions, representing the three colors of the Indian flag:
    - **Saffron** at the top
    - **White** in the middle (with the Ashoka Chakra)
    - **Green** at the bottom

2. The **Ashoka Chakra** is represented as a circle placed in the center of the middle white section.

3. The CSS file is responsible for styling the flag and positioning the elements using absolute and relative positioning.

### Flag Details:
- The flag's top section is colored **saffron** (`#F89432`).
- The middle section is colored **white** (`#F7F7F7`).
- The bottom section is colored **green** (`#3C8125`).
- The **Ashoka Chakra** is placed in the center of the white section as a blue circle with lines radiating outward.

## Customizations

- You can adjust the size of the flag by modifying the `width` and `height` properties in the `.flag-box` class in the `styles.css` file.
- The Ashoka Chakra image can be customized by modifying the `background-image` property inside the `.lines` class.
