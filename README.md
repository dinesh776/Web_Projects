# Web Projects

Welcome to my **Web Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of various web projects that I have developed. Each project demonstrates different aspects of web development, including front-end and back-end technologies, frameworks, and libraries.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder with the following structure:
- ```bash
        Web_Projects/
            |_ ProjectName/
                |_ index.html
                |_ styles.css
                |_ script.js
                |_ images
                |_ README.md


- **ProjectName**: Each folder is named according to the project it contains.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the project.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the project.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the project.
- **images**: All the Images used in that project will be in this folder
- **README.md**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, its features, and how to run it.
