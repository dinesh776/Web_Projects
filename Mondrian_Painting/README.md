# Mondrian Design Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Mondrian Design** project‚Äîa front-end web application built using HTML and CSS to replicate the distinctive geometric style of Piet Mondrian. This project focuses on the layout and color palette to create an abstract composition using a grid system, with careful attention to alignment and spacing.

## Features

### üñºÔ∏è Geometric Layout
- **CSS Grid Layout**: The design is constructed using CSS Grid, creating a structured, balanced composition of colored blocks.
- **Mondrian Color Palette**: The project uses a predefined color scheme, staying true to Mondrian‚Äôs style, with bold primary colors and stark black lines.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring consistent visual experience across devices.

### üé® Key Sections
- **Red Block**: A large red block in the top-left corner representing Mondrian's characteristic use of bold, primary colors.
- **White and Black Blocks**: These blocks provide balance and contrast, capturing the essence of Mondrian's minimalism.
- **Blue and Yellow Blocks**: Secondary elements that introduce additional color variety while maintaining harmony in the design.

### üåê Pure HTML and CSS
This project was developed using **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on structure, layout, and visual balance. There is no JavaScript or interactive elements, emphasizing the simplicity and clarity of the Mondrian design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the page and creating the grid layout.
- **CSS3**: For applying styles, grid properties, and ensuring responsiveness.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple directory structure:
1. ```bash
      MondrianDesign/
               ‚îÇ
               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         
               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css         
               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /images
               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

- `index.html`: This file contains the structure of the Mondrian design layout, with colored blocks organized using a grid system.
- `style.css`: The CSS file manages the overall layout, applying colors and setting the grid properties to achieve the Mondrian look.
- `images`: This folder contains any reference images or additional assets used in the project.

## Setup Instructions

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd MondrianDesign

### Open the project:
Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the Mondrian design. No additional setup is required, as it‚Äôs a static site with only HTML and CSS.
